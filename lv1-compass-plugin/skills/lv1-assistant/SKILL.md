name: lv1-assistant
description: Produce a trustworthy work deliverable — an analysis, report, memo, brief, slide deck, or spreadsheet model — through a disciplined pipeline: triage → sourced research → outline → draft → independent inspection → ship with a proof package. Use when the user wants something *made* or *written* for work. Every factual claim is graded (A/B/C/D) and traced to a real source; nothing ships unless it is impressive AND true. Not for reviewing an existing document or weighing a decision — that is lv1-advisor.

# lv1-assistant — the maker

The make-half of lv1-compass: a disciplined pipeline that turns a work brief into a
deliverable a reader can both trust and verify. Narrower than a general writing tool — it
covers **work deliverables** in one of two registers, not the open-ended genre/tone space.

**Read first, every run:** the shared constitution at `core/constitution.md` (from this
skill: `../../core/constitution.md`) and `core/working-lessons.md`. They define the bar,
the A/B/C/D grades, the `[A]` provenance test, the failure modes, and the lessons every
station obeys. This skill does not restate them — it applies them.

The two stations most at risk of being quietly under-built run as **isolated subagents**
with their own context: **research** (`lv1-research`) closes only when its claim ledger is
fully sourced, and **inspection** (`lv1-inspect`) is mechanically independent — it never
saw the drafting reasoning — and runs a coverage gate that can send thin research back for
more.

## The bar

> **Impressive AND true.** A deliverable that dazzles but is false fails. One that is true
> but thin also fails. Ship only what clears both, backed by sources a reader can check.

## One knob + a register (set in triage)

Unlike the wider writing tool, the assistant sets one main knob — there is no genre/tone
detection, and **no output-format knob**:

1. **Rigor tier** — `tiny | normal | full | high-stakes` (from `core/constitution.md`).
   Per the tier→station table there, it gates *which stations actually run* and how much
   proof apparatus ships.

**Output is always markdown.** The pipeline produces a markdown deliverable so the
independent inspector — which has only Read/Grep/Glob — can judge the *real* shipped
artifact. If the user needs a `docx` / `pptx` / `xlsx`, that is an **explicit conversion
step after inspection passes** (step 7), run on the approved markdown via the office skill —
never a pipeline-internal format the inspector can't read.

The **work register** (analytical | neutral-professional) and **structure shape** are the
two lighter choices, also set in triage — see `references/register.md`.

## The pipeline

```
triage → (source-intake / research) → outline → draft (+ self-review) → inspect → ship
              ▲                            ▲                               │
              │                            └────────── fix-it ◀────────────┤
              └─────────────── redo-research ◀──────────────────────────────┘
```

(`research` and `inspect` run as isolated subagents — `lv1-research` and `lv1-inspect`.
The orchestrator delegates and integrates; the two loops are driven by the inspector's
verdict.)

> **Passing the discipline to a subagent (required).** A subagent runs from the project
> directory and **cannot read the plugin's `core/` from its own path**. So when you
> delegate, paste the governing context into the subagent's task prompt: the contents of
> `../../core/constitution.md` and `../../core/working-lessons.md` (which you, the
> orchestrator, can read). Without this the subagent runs blind to the bar and the grades.

1. **Set up the run.** Create `runs/<UTC-timestamp>-<short-slug>/`. Tell the user the run
   id.
2. **Triage.** Read `references/triage.md` and follow it. Write `00-triage.md`: rigor tier,
   work register, structure shape, scope, an optional convert-to target, and (full/
   high-stakes) a research contract. If scope is genuinely ambiguous, ask one batched round
   (rule 1). On `tiny`, say you're running the fast lane: the station set is **triage →
   draft → self-review → ship** (research, outline, and the inspect subagent are skipped).
   **But if the tiny task carries any factual claim, escalate to `normal`** — the fast lane
   has no station to source a claim, and rule 5 (no source, no claim) still binds.
3. **Gather material.** For a source handed over (PDF, Word, image, URL), read
   `references/source-intake.md` and add it to `sources/library.md`. For facts still
   missing, **delegate to the `lv1-research` subagent** — it writes `01-research.md` as a
   graded claim ledger and returns a summary. Don't move on until every claim the
   deliverable needs is a ledger row sourced (A/B) or marked a declared gap.
4. **Outline.** Read `references/outline.md` and follow it. Write `02-outline.md`.
5. **Draft.** Read `references/draft.md` and follow it: compose the voice from the register
   in `00-triage.md`, apply the apparatus for the rigor tier, and let format follow content.
   Write the markdown deliverable to `manuscript/` and a copy to `03-draft.md`. Run the
   self-review pass before moving on.
6. **Inspect.** **Delegate to the `lv1-inspect` subagent** (pipeline mode). It re-reads the
   real draft, `sources/library.md`, and `01-research.md` from disk and writes
   `04-inspection.md` with one verdict:
   - **FIX-IT** → a draft problem. Back to draft with the full findings, fix every one,
     re-inspect **from scratch**. Cap 3 rounds; else REJECT.
   - **REDO-RESEARCH** → honest draft, too-thin research base. Back to **research** with the
     named gaps. Cap 2 redos; then ship with gaps declared or REJECT.
   - **REJECT** → stop. Report honestly. Do not ship.
   - **PASS** → ship.
7. **Ship.** Write `05-manifest.md`: a confidence list (every factual claim, its grade, its
   source), an assumptions list, a receipts index. For **full / high-stakes**, also
   **append the proof package to the delivered file itself** (confidence table,
   assumptions, source index, data-limits) — the reader should verify without opening
   `runs/`. Lighter tiers keep grades in a closing note. Deliver the file plus a short
   cover note; state overall confidence and any open assumptions plainly.
8. **Convert (only if `Convert-to` was set in triage).** On the **approved, inspected**
   markdown, invoke the matching office skill to produce the `docx` / `pptx` / `xlsx`:
   - **docx** — memos, reports, letters, briefs (heading structure + tables + appended proof package).
   - **pptx** — readouts, decks (one idea per slide; grades/sources in speaker notes, clean slide face).
   - **xlsx** — models, data tables, trackers (schema, formulas, source per input figure).
   Conversion is format only — it must not add or change a claim. If it would, stop and
   re-inspect. Save the converted file to `manuscript/` alongside the markdown.

After each station, give the user a one-line status (e.g. "Research: 12 facts, all
sourced"). If you cut a corner, say so — never fake a step (R4).

## A single source you're handed mid-task

If the user just hands over a file or link without asking for the full pipeline, read
`references/source-intake.md`, add it to `sources/library.md`, and report the source id and
what's now citable — no run folder needed.
